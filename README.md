Learning about widgets in Flutter has really helped me understand how the user interface is built. Everything in Flutter is a widget, whether it’s a button, text, or the entire app. Widgets come in two main types: stateless and stateful. Stateless widgets are fixed and don’t change once they’re created, while stateful widgets can change over time based on user input or other factors.

I also learned about the concept of a full widget tree, which is how the app’s entire structure is laid out. It’s like a hierarchy, where one widget contains other widgets. For example, a MaterialApp widget might hold a Scaffold, which then holds other widgets like an AppBar and Text. A full widget tree helps build complex layouts and interactions by nesting widgets within one another.

On the flip side, I discovered the idea of a shallow widget tree, which is about improving performance. Instead of rebuilding the entire widget tree every time something changes, a shallow tree only rebuilds the parts that need to be updated. This makes the app faster and more efficient, especially as it gets bigger.
Overall, learning how widgets work and how to organize them has given me a better understanding of how Flutter builds apps and how to make them efficient and dynamic.
